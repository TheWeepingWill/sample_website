			The <a href="https://www.softcover.io">Softcover</a> publishing platfor <br>
			was designed mainly for e-books like the <br>
			<a href="https://railsututorial.org/book">Ruby on Rails tutorial<em>book</em></a><br>
			and <a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn Enough <br>
			HTML to be dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more <br>
			traditional books such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by<br> 
			Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). Below we <br>
			present a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic <br>
			of American literature.

		<em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
		by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago–never mind how long <br>
			precisely–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing<br>
			particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a<br>
			little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of<br>
			driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), <br>
		Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one<br>
		jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who—<em>spoiler<br>
		alert!</em>—is a giant white whale) is the book itself.<br>
