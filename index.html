	<h1>The Learn enough Story</h1>
	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach<br>
		<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take<br>
		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes<br>
		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,<br>
		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br>
		We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from<br>
		learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our<br>
		movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>Learn enough to be dangers is an outgrowth of the <br>
		<a href="https://railstutorials.org/">Ruby on rails tutorial</a> and the <br>
		<a href="https://softcover.io/">Soft cover publishing platform</a>.<br>
		This page is part of an sample site for <br>
		<a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn enough HTML <br>
		to be dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <br>
		<strong>H</strong><strong>yper</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>ext</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>arkup</strong>

	<h2>Founders</h2>

	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee <br>
		Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical <br>
		sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit<br>
		<strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.<br>

	<h3>Micheal Hartl</h3>
	 <p>
      Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.

	<h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
	  <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

	<h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
	  <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
