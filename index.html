	<h1>The Learn enough Story</h1>
	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach<br>
		<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take<br>
		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes<br>
		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,<br>
		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br>
		We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from<br>
		learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our<br>
		movement, sign up for our official email list now.

	<h2>Background</h2>

	<h2>Foounders</h2>

	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee <br>
		Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical <br>
		sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit<br>
		<strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.<br>
