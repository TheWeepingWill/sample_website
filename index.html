	<h1>The Learn enough Story</h1>
	<p>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach<br>
		<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take<br>
		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes<br>
		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,<br>
		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br>
		We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from<br>
		learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our<br>
		movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.
