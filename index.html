	<h1>The Learn enough Story</h1>
	<h1>
		Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach<br>
		<em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take<br>
		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes<br>
		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,<br>
		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.<br>
		We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from<br>
		learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our<br>

<h2>Quotations</h2>

<p>
	In addition to supplying most of the worlds supply of kitten videos the Web <br>
	is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one.

<h2>Background</h2>


<p>Learn enough to be dangers is an outgrowth of the <br>
	<a href="https://railstutorials.org/">Ruby on rails tutorial</a> and the <br>
	<a href="https://softcover.io/">Soft cover publishing platform</a>.<br>
	This page is part of an sample site for <br>
	<a href="https://learnenough.com/html"><em>Learn enough HTML <br>
	to be dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of <br>
	<strong>H</strong><strong>yper</strong><strong>T</strong><strong>ext</strong><strong>M</strong><strong>arkup</strong> 
	<strong>L</strong><strong>anguage</strong>, <br>the universal language of the World Wide Web. <br>
	other related tutorials can be found at <br>

</p>

<h2 id="founders">Founders</h2>

<p>
	Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee <br>
	Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical <br>
	sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit<br>
	<strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.<br>

	Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
	Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
	<a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
	introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
	<a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
	plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
	are slightly exaggerated.

<p>
	When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
	on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
	interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
	interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

<p>
	You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
	Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
	at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
	tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
